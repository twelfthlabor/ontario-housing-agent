# Ontario Housing Agent

A free public demo where visitors chat with a tool-calling LLM agent about a
research sample of 19,356 Ontario for-sale listings across 36 cities. The agent
answers questions like "median asking price for a 3-bed in Hamilton?" or "how
many listings are in M6P?" by calling deterministic search and stats functions
over a JSON dataset. Numbers come from those functions; the model picks tools
and writes the reply. Search and snapshot tools accept a 3-character FSA (a full
postal code is reduced to it), and snapshots accept price, bedroom, and
minimum-bath filters. The agent can also rank a city's postal areas by median
asking price or listing count. Search answers render up to six listing cards
(each with its address and a link to the source listing) and a sample-size line.
Tool-using answers include a collapsed "How this answer was computed" block with
the raw tool calls. The atlas has a Data tab with a CSV export, and its state
(city, compare pair, sort, price ceiling, tab, view) is mirrored into the URL so
a view can be shared.

Not a valuation tool, listing service, or source of financial advice. See
[Disclaimers](#disclaimers).

## Who it is for

- Visitors who want quick, data-grounded answers about asking prices in the
  covered cities.
- Developers looking for a small, readable example of a tool-calling agent loop
  with rate-limit guardrails and a deterministic offline test mode.

## Quickstart

These steps run the demo locally; the live demo is at the URL above.
Requires Node.js 24 and Python 3. Run all commands from this directory
(`ontario-housing-agent/`), with the `property-scraper` checkout as a sibling.

```bash
npm install
python3 pipeline/build_dataset.py            # writes data/listings.json + data/market_summary.json
MOCK_LLM=1 npm run dev                       # open the URL printed by Next.js
npm test                                     # vitest: tools, agent, guards, routes, providers, observability, evals
npm run build                                # production build; npm start serves it
MOCK_LLM=1 npm run evals                     # golden harness, plumbing only (no network)
```

`MOCK_LLM=1` runs a deterministic mock instead of calling Groq, so the quickstart
needs no API key. For the real model, put `GROQ_API_KEY` in `.env.local` and run `npm run dev`
without `MOCK_LLM=1`. The app shows an offline-demo notice when using scripted replies.
Both Next.js and `npm run evals` load `.env.local`; exported environment variables
take precedence for the eval command. Restart the server after changing providers or data.

`npm run evals` runs the 38 golden cases (16 tool choice, including 4
multi-turn cases and 2 capability cases for filtered snapshots and area
rankings; 10 numeric; 12 refusals) and needs `GROQ_API_KEY` for live scoring;
without a key it exits 1 with instructions. `MOCK_LLM=1 npm run evals` runs the
plumbing only. Each run writes `evals/report.json`, which is gitignored, and
the harness updates it after every case so an aborted run keeps partial
results. Reports include the answers and tool arguments for diagnosis. Live
bars: tool choice >= 0.90, numeric >= 0.95, refusals 1.00. `quality_gate_passed`
stays false for mock runs and partial runs (`--limit` or `--category` selecting
fewer than all cases), even if their selected cases pass. The last completed
full live pass is the 32-case gate from 2026-09-16; the 38-case suite has not
completed a live run (2026-09-17 attempts hit the Groq free-tier daily token
cap).

`pipeline/build_dataset.py` reads `../property-scraper/data/regions` by default;
pass `--source <dir>` to point it elsewhere. Listing ids are used for dedupe and
never written.

## Environment variables

| Variable | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `GROQ_API_KEY` | Groq API key. Required to call the real model; not needed with `MOCK_LLM=1`. |
| `GROQ_MODEL` | Override the Groq model id; the demo uses `openai/gpt-oss-120b`. |
| `GEMINI_API_KEY` | Optional fallback provider, used only when set and a Groq call fails before emitting output. Groq remains the primary free provider. Keep billing disabled on both accounts. |
| `GEMINI_MODEL` | Optional fallback model override; defaults to `gemini-2.5-flash-lite`. |
| `MOCK_LLM` | Set to `1` to use the deterministic mock LLM (tests/CI; no key needed). |

## Disclaimers

- The dataset is a research sample of public for-sale listing data (Zillow).
  It includes each listing's address and a link to the source listing; listing
  ids, agent names, and scraped source pages are not published. Not affiliated
  with Zillow.
- Asking prices only; no sold prices. Square footage covers about 20% of rows and
  varies by city; values outside a plausible 200-20,000 sqft range (for example,
  land listings whose acreage the source renders as interior square feet) are
  treated as missing. The sample is a single snapshot and can be stale.
- Nothing here is financial, legal, or real-estate advice.
- The demo runs on free tiers: Groq for the model and Vercel Hobby for hosting.
  Exhausting the daily free-tier token quota can make it unavailable during
  traffic spikes.
